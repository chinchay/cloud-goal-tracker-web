# Overview

The purpose of this Habit Tracker Web application is to help you to maintain good habits to reach your goals through gamification (turning your goals into a game). This software retrieves information saved in a cloud database and shows the history of achievements, or you can update/modify new goals achieved from the web browser interface.

For new users, the software will ask them to register a username and password. For old users, a login process will be required to grant access to the main interface of this program. From the interface, you are allowed to connect to a cloud database to perform visualizations and updating tasks by just following the program prompts.

A demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code can be found [here]().

Detailed specifications of this program can be found [here]().
